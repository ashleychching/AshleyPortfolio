        <section class="content-section">
            <p>In 2020, just as the pandemic swept the world, I set out to pursue my dream of building something from scratch. My quest is to build a badminton app that would help players track their rankings and tournament results. I wanted to create a platform that would make it easier for players to find tournaments, register for them, and track their progress.</p>
            
            <p>Competitive badminton players often struggle to track their rankings and tournament results. The existing solutions were fragmented and difficult to use. Players had to visit multiple websites to find tournaments, register for them, and track their progress. This was a time-consuming and frustrating process.</p>
            
            <p>As such, <strong>Gamification was a platform where creators could ask their digital art and NFTs to collectors</strong>. Everything was created from the ground up, including the design system, user flows, and the final product. The platform was designed to be simple and intuitive, with a focus on the user experience.</p>

            <h2>The problem</h2>
            <p>For years, I've had a dream to build a product—but where do you even begin? I struggled to find a starting point. The ideation stage was tough, and I needed to find a problem worth solving. I spent months researching and talking to potential users to understand their pain points.</p>
            
            <p>So at the time, I was playing a lot of badminton. I noticed that players were struggling to track their rankings and tournament results. The existing solutions were fragmented and difficult to use. Players had to visit multiple websites to find tournaments, register for them, and track their progress. This was a time-consuming and frustrating process.</p>
            
            <p>I realized that there was an opportunity to create a platform that would make it easier for players to find tournaments, register for them, and track their progress. I wanted to create a platform that would be simple and intuitive, with a focus on the user experience. But I also knew that I needed to validate my idea before investing too much time and money into it.</p>
            
            <p>That's when I turned about Lean Startup. Screw it, I decided to just go ahead and build it. I didn't have all the answers, but I knew that I had to start somewhere. I decided to build a minimum viable product (MVP) and test it with real users. I wanted to see if there was a demand for the product before investing too much time and money into it.</p>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>My role</h2>
            <p>I played a senior UX/product designer role on this project, graphic design, and head of marketing (content, product). I was responsible for the entire design process, from research to final implementation. I worked closely with the development team to ensure that the design was implemented correctly.</p>
            
            <p>Additionally, I performed user research, created wireframes and prototypes, and conducted usability testing. I also created the design system and style guide for the project. I was responsible for the entire design process, from research to final implementation.</p>
            
            <p>I worked on this project for 3 months, and it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my career. I learned a lot about the design process and how to work with a development team. I also learned a lot about myself and what I'm capable of.</p>

            <h2>Open sourcing</h2>
            <p>When deciding when I contributed to a Sketch library, we realized it was more like 200k, and ultimately we decided to open source it. We wanted to give back to the design community and help other designers create better products.</p>
            
            <p>We also wanted to make it easier for designers to get started with Sketch. We created a comprehensive library of components and styles that designers could use in their projects. We also created documentation and tutorials to help designers get started.</p>
