            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>The client wanted a redesign of their website because their design was not very welcoming and very text heavy. Their design was not user-centric and they wanted more clients that would be drawn in from their digital presence.</p>
            
            <p>The existing website suffered from several critical issues that were hampering user engagement and conversion rates. Dense paragraphs of text overwhelmed visitors, making it difficult to quickly understand the services offered. The lack of visual hierarchy and poor use of whitespace created a cluttered, uninviting experience that failed to build trust with potential clients.</p>
            
            <p>The client recognized that in today's digital landscape, first impressions matter immensely. They needed a website that would not only inform visitors but also engage them and guide them toward becoming customers.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h3>Original Design</h3>
            <p>The website before the redesign featured a text-dominant layout with minimal visual interest. Key information was buried in long paragraphs, and the overall aesthetic failed to convey professionalism and trustworthiness.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="project-images-grid">
            <img src="images/law1.png" alt="Original website homepage">
            <img src="images/law2.png" alt="Original website services page">
        </div>

        <div class="project-images-grid">
            <img src="images/law3.png" alt="Original website full layout">
            <img src="images/law4.png" alt="Original website full layout">
        </div>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>My design had to be more aesthetic and practical so that people were more likely to be drawn into the business as consumers. I decided to proceed with the colors of yellow and blue because their branding already consisted of blue. I thought that yellow was a complementary color because the colors together create a sense of trustworthiness.</p>
            
            <p>The redesign focused on three core principles: visual appeal, information clarity, and conversion optimization. Every design decision was made with the user journey in mind, ensuring that visitors could quickly understand the value proposition and take action.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Key Design Decisions</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Dynamic Landing Screen with Carousel</h3>
            <p>I made the landing screen a carousel of all of the services that they provide. This would make the screen more enticing and lead the user to learn more about the services, therefore creating a more trustworthy image.</p>
            
            <p>The carousel approach transformed the homepage from a static wall of text into an engaging, interactive experience. Each slide highlights a key service with compelling visuals and concise copy, encouraging users to explore further and learn about the full range of offerings.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="project-images-grid">
            <img src="images/law5.png" alt="New landing page with carousel">
        </div>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h3>2. Reduced Text Density & Improved Information Architecture</h3>
            <p>Since the previous design was so text heavy, I minimized the text by creating a separate tab for the legal disclaimers in the footer. With the incorporation of a footer component and an "About Us" tab, the brand is able to remind consumers of why they would be the better choice as compared to other services.</p>
            
            <p>This strategic reorganization of content achieved multiple goals. Legal disclaimers and detailed terms were moved to appropriate locations, allowing the main pages to focus on value propositions and user benefits. The new footer serves as a comprehensive navigation hub while keeping important information accessible without overwhelming the main content areas.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="project-images-grid">
            <img src="images/law6.png" alt="New footer design">
        </div>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h3>3. Optimized Contact Page for Conversions</h3>
            <p>I also made the contact page much more legible, and therefore much more likely to make a conversion from a regular site browser to a consumer.</p>
            
            <p>The redesigned contact page features a clean, intuitive form layout with clear labels and visual feedback. By reducing friction in the contact process and making the form more approachable, we significantly increased the likelihood of visitors reaching out to become clients.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="project-images-grid">
            <img src="images/law3.png" alt="Original contact page">
            <img src="images/law7.png" alt="Redesigned contact page">
        </div>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Color Psychology & Brand Identity</h2>
            <p>The color palette of blue and yellow was carefully chosen to evoke specific emotional responses. Blue, already part of the existing brand, conveys professionalism, reliability, and trust. Yellow adds warmth, optimism, and approachability. Together, these colors create a balanced visual identity that is both trustworthy and inviting.</p>
            
            <p>The complementary nature of these colors also ensures good contrast and readability throughout the site, making content easier to consume and navigate.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
            <p>The redesign successfully transformed the client's digital presence from a text-heavy, overwhelming experience to a welcoming, user-centric platform. Key improvements include:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Enhanced Visual Appeal:</strong> The new design immediately captures attention with its balanced use of color, whitespace, and engaging visuals, creating a strong first impression.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Improved Information Accessibility:</strong> By reorganizing content and reducing text density, users can now quickly find the information they need without feeling overwhelmed.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Higher Conversion Potential:</strong> The streamlined contact page and clear calls-to-action throughout the site create more opportunities for visitors to become clients.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Stronger Brand Identity:</strong> The cohesive design language and strategic use of color reinforce the client's professional image and build trust with potential customers.</p>
            
            <p>The redesigned website now serves as an effective digital storefront that attracts, engages, and converts visitors, directly supporting the client's business growth objectives.</p>
