            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Cities are hard to maintain and often become run down. To keep our cities nice to live in, we can use a gamified system in order to incentivize citizens to track repairs. If there are any broken benches, lamps, or any potholes in roads making life more difficult, it should be tracked to let public officials know about how budgets should be allocated.</p>
            
            <p>The challenge lies in the disconnect between citizens who notice issues daily and the public officials responsible for addressing them. Traditional reporting methods are cumbersome, leading to underreporting and deteriorating urban infrastructure. Cities need a more efficient way to crowdsource information about repairs while motivating citizens to participate.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>Because it is so difficult to track things that need to be repaired in a robust city, an app that outsources the labor to the users to track the repairs a city needs improves the quality of life that the average citizen can experience.</p>
            
            <p>Fix City combines civic responsibility with game mechanics to create an engaging experience. The project has <strong>3 different main tabs</strong> to separate the app into different sub actions:</p>
            
            <ul style="margin: 1.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Home Page:</strong> Made for the purpose of exploring and browsing the repairs</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Create Post Tab:</strong> Designed to simplify making a post and sharing your information</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Profile Page:</strong> Used to track your progress and past posts that you have made</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Home Page - Browse & Explore</h2>
            <p>The home page is designed to be as informative as possible for public officials to use as well as users to interact with.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="project-images-grid">
            <img src="/placeholder.svg?height=600&width=400" alt="Fix City home page showing repair posts">
        </div>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <p><strong>Profile Pictures & Avatar System:</strong> The profile picture is an icon character that you can purchase with points that you can earn within the app. The more you interact with the app, the more points you gain and the more badges you can earn.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Visual Documentation:</strong> Each post has images and locations where you found the repair issue. Another group member during the hackathon was working on the map API implementation on the app.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Smart Sorting:</strong> The posts would likely be ordered by upvotes as well as locations, ensuring the most urgent or popular repair requests get prioritized.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Reporting Page - Create Posts</h2>
            <p>The reporting page is used to share the details of the repairs that need to be made. The design focuses on simplicity and clarity to encourage users to submit reports quickly and accurately.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="project-images-grid">
            <img src="/placeholder.svg?height=600&width=400" alt="Fix City reporting page with form inputs">
        </div>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h3>Intuitive Input Design</h3>
            <p><strong>Example-Driven Forms:</strong> All of the input boxes have example inputs so that the user can know what type of data is expected to be input. This reduces friction and helps users understand exactly what information is needed.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Flexible Location Sharing:</strong> There are two separate types of ways to input your location based on your preference on sharing the location. There is a map that shares your current location as well as an input bar where you can enter location manually.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Photo Upload:</strong> There is also a photo upload section so that you could choose media to accompany the location where the repair needs to be made. Visual documentation helps officials understand the severity and nature of the issue.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Profile Page - Track Progress</h2>
            <p>This is the profile page that is used to track progress of the user. Gamification elements are front and center to motivate continued engagement.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="project-images-grid">
            <img src="/placeholder.svg?height=600&width=400" alt="Fix City profile page with badges and history">
        </div>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h3>Gamification Elements</h3>
            <p><strong>Badge System:</strong> The top banner of the page is a badge that incentivizes users to use the app. The badge would represent what level the user would be, and of course would change based on their achievements. This creates a sense of progression and accomplishment.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Repair History:</strong> Right below the banner is the past repairs that you have reported. A record of your past repairs is noted because users would like to keep track of what they have seen in the past and how they have earned their points. This personal history creates investment in the platform and allows users to see the tangible impact of their contributions.</p>

            <h2>Learning Experience</h2>
            <p>Overall, my first hackathon was an enlightening experience where I learned how to use new technologies such as Flutter. I had a quick start on developing software for mobile devices. I also learned to create new designs and prototypes in a short amount of time.</p>
            
            <p>I had to learn not to get too attached to my designs as that would be detrimental to the improvement and iteration of my design. I created multiple types of designs in order to find the style that fit the app and goals.</p>
            
            <p>This project taught me valuable lessons about rapid prototyping, user-centered design under time constraints, and the importance of balancing functionality with engagement. Working collaboratively with team members who were handling different aspects of the app (like the map API implementation) also gave me insight into cross-functional product development.</p>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Impact & Vision</h2>
            <p>Fix City demonstrates how technology can bridge the gap between citizens and government services. By making civic participation fun and rewarding, the app has the potential to:</p>
            
            <ul style="margin: 1.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Increase the reporting rate of urban infrastructure issues</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Help municipalities prioritize budget allocation based on real citizen input</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Foster a sense of community ownership and civic pride</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Reduce response times for repairs through better documentation and visibility</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The gamification elements ensure sustained engagement, turning a civic duty into an enjoyable activity that benefits everyone in the community.</p>
