            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Screen time is at an all-time high, and many people struggle to maintain healthy digital habits. While there are apps that track screen time, they often feel isolating and lack the social motivation needed to create lasting behavioral change. People are more likely to stick to their goals when they have friends supporting and encouraging them along the way.</p>
            
            <p>The challenge lies in making screen time reduction fun rather than restrictive. Traditional tracking apps can feel judgmental or punishing, which often leads to users abandoning them. We need a solution that leverages social accountability while keeping the experience positive and engaging.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>Pancake Pals transforms screen time tracking from a solitary struggle into a shared journey with friends. By combining accurate screen time monitoring with social features and friendly competition, the app motivates users to build healthier digital habits together.</p>
            
            <p>The app features <strong>3 core sections</strong> designed to make digital wellness social and achievable:</p>
            
            <ul style="margin: 1.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Dashboard:</strong> View your daily screen time stats and compare progress with your friend group</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Friends Feed:</strong> See your friends' achievements, celebrate milestones, and send encouragement</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Challenges:</strong> Set individual goals and participate in group challenges with rewards and friendly competition</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Dashboard - Track & Compare</h2>
            <p>The dashboard provides a clear overview of your screen time habits while allowing you to see how you stack up against your friends—not in a judgmental way, but as motivation and inspiration.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="project-images-grid">
            <img src="/placeholder.svg?height=600&width=400" alt="Pancake Pals dashboard showing screen time stats">
        </div>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <p><strong>Visual Screen Time Breakdown:</strong> Beautiful charts and graphs show your daily, weekly, and monthly screen time trends. Color-coded categories help you identify which apps are consuming most of your time, making it easier to set targeted goals.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Friend Leaderboard:</strong> A friendly leaderboard shows who in your group is making the most progress toward their goals. The design emphasizes positive progress rather than shaming, with encouraging messages and celebration of small wins.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Personalized Insights:</strong> The app provides intelligent insights about your usage patterns, suggesting optimal times for phone breaks and highlighting positive trends in your behavior.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Friends Feed - Stay Connected</h2>
            <p>The Friends Feed creates a supportive community atmosphere where users can celebrate each other's progress, share tips, and provide encouragement during challenging moments.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="project-images-grid">
            <img src="/placeholder.svg?height=600&width=400" alt="Pancake Pals friends feed showing achievements">
        </div>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h3>Social Motivation</h3>
            <p><strong>Achievement Sharing:</strong> When friends hit their daily goals or complete challenges, their accomplishments appear in the feed. Users can react with supportive emojis and encouraging comments, creating positive reinforcement.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Pancake Stack System:</strong> Each day you meet your screen time goal, you add a pancake to your stack. The higher your stack, the more impressive your consistency. Friends can see your stack and cheer you on as you build your tower of healthy habits.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Support Messages:</strong> Having a tough day? Your friends can send supportive messages and reminders directly through the feed. The app also suggests encouraging messages when it detects someone in your group might need motivation.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Challenges - Set Goals Together</h2>
            <p>The Challenges section transforms screen time reduction into an engaging game where friends can compete in friendly challenges or work together toward shared goals.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="project-images-grid">
            <img src="/placeholder.svg?height=600&width=400" alt="Pancake Pals challenges page with group goals">
        </div>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h3>Engaging Competition</h3>
            <p><strong>Weekly Challenges:</strong> Join pre-made challenges like "Social Media Detox Weekend" or "No Phone Before Noon," or create custom challenges for your friend group. Challenges have clear goals, time limits, and rewards for completion.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Team vs. Solo Modes:</strong> Choose to compete individually or form teams within your friend group. Team mode encourages collaboration, as everyone's progress contributes to the team's success.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Reward System:</strong> Complete challenges to earn digital pancakes, unlock fun themes and customizations for your profile, and collect badges that showcase your achievements. The reward system is designed to feel celebratory rather than addictive.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Learning Experience</h2>
            <p>Building Pancake Pals during the hackathon was an intensive learning experience in designing for behavioral change. We had to balance the desire for engagement with the risk of creating another addictive app—the very thing we were trying to help users avoid.</p>
            
            <p>Working with React Native allowed us to build cross-platform functionality quickly, which was crucial given our tight timeline. We integrated screen time tracking APIs for both iOS and Android, learning to handle platform-specific permissions and data access along the way.</p>
            
            <p>User testing during the hackathon revealed that people responded best to positive reinforcement rather than guilt or shame. This insight shaped our design language, leading us to emphasize celebration, support, and friendly competition rather than punishment for screen time usage.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Impact & Vision</h2>
            <p>Pancake Pals demonstrates that technology can be part of the solution to our screen time challenges, not just the problem. By leveraging social connection and positive psychology principles, the app has the potential to:</p>
            
            <ul style="margin: 1.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Help users build awareness of their digital habits without feeling judged</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Create accountability through friend groups that encourage healthier behavior</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Make screen time reduction feel like a fun challenge rather than a restriction</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Foster deeper connections between friends through shared goals and mutual support</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The pancake metaphor—stacking small, consistent wins—serves as a powerful reminder that building better habits is a gradual process. Just like making a delicious stack of pancakes, creating lasting change happens one layer at a time, and it's always better with friends.</p>
